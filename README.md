The app uses these technologies:

* AngularJS 1.4.x
* Firebase 2.2.x
* AngularFire 1.1.x
* Bootstrap 3.3.x
* Zapier

AngularJS code style and application structure. That's because it follows [John Papa's AngularJS style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide),
which is the style guide recommended by the AngularJS core team.

Thanks to Gordon Zhu for his tutorial.
